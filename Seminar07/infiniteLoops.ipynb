    "\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "* Double check your `while` condition!\n",
    "    * E.g. if you are waiting for an iterative computation to converge, your tolerance might be too small, or you might have mixed up a `<` and a `>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert your `while` loops to `for` loops!\n",
    "    * Sometimes it makes sense to introduce a `max_iteration` parameter set to a high number,\n",
    "    and terminate the loop if this number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "    This is common practice in many optimization algorithms.\n",
    "    * If this is not feasible,\n",
    "    you can *temporarily* replace `while XXX` with `for i in range(100)` to make sure the loop terminates.\n",
    "    Afterwards you can check the results of the computations in the loop.\n",

    "        list_of_errors = do_some_computations()\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    To get a better idea of what's going on, you can print `max(list_of_errors)` or `list_of_errors` after every iteration.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    The most effective way to debug most issues is to use a debugger.\n",

    "    Other editors will have different commands/buttons/shortcuts.\n",
